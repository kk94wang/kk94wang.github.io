I'm a currently Ph.D. student at [SHI-Labs](https://www.shi-labs.com/), advised by [Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/). My research interests focus on computer vision and deep learning.  
Before joining SHI-Labs, I obtained M.S. in Computer Science from University of Minnesota Twin Cities in 2020, and B.S. in Physics from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.
