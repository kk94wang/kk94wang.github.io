I am a Ph.D. student at [SHI-Labs](https://www.shi-labs.com/) advised by [Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/). My research interests focus on computer vision and deep learning. 

Before joining SHI-Labs, I received my MS degree from University of Minnesota Twin Cities in 2020, and my BS degree from University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.
