I am currently a Ph.D. student at [SHI Labs](https://www.shi-labs.com/), under the guidance of Professor [Humphrey Shi](https://www.humphreyshi.com/). My research interests lies at computer vision and deep learning.  
Prior to joining SHI Labs, I received M.S. in Computer Science from the University of Minnesota Twin Cities in 2020, and B.S. in Physics from the University of Science and Technology of China in 2016.
